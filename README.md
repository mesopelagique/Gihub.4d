## Doing request

Example: Getting information about current authenticated user

```4d
$result:=$github.request("/user")
```

### Cheking result

| $result attribute |Description | 
|--|-- | 
| .success | Will return `True` if the request was successful, `False` otherwise | 
| .value | The requested data decoded as object or collection | 
| .code | The HTTP code returned by request | 

If `$result.success`is `False` you will receive an `Error` object with basic information about the issue like `.message`.

### Endpoints

To help with request some github api endpoints are already implemented. This endpoints will decode into class instances.

#### Get information of user authenticated

```4d
$result:=$github.user()
// $result.value is an User object.
```
